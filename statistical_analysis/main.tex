\section{Maximum trophic level model}

%%
\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{
        \textbf{Summary table of estimated parameters for the maximum trophic level model.}
        The column name shows the terms included in the linear predictive function $\hat{Y}$ of the model and the log posterior density, denoted $\log P$.
        The MaP, mean, and sd, column correspond to the maximum \textit{a posteriori} (i.e. the value that maximises the log-posterior density), mean, and standard deviation of each term, estimated from the chains.
        The quantities $q_{05}, q_{50}, q_{95}$ correspond to the $5\%$, $50\%$, and $95\%$ quantiles of the estimated distribution of each term.
        The quantity $\hat{r}$ refers to the convergence index (\cite{Gelman1995}), which indicates whether the chains have converged or not.
        The significativity column shows whether the $90\%$ confidence interval of a given term excludes 0 or not.
