## Folder content
This folder contains the following files:  
- `community_lake.rda` – (4,305 lines x 5 columns) – includes the sampling event ID (`id_campagne`), the species code (`species`) and the associated biomass (`biomass`) and length (`length`) as well as the number of individuals with these attributes (`nind`).  
- `community_lake_metrics.rda` – (4,305 lines x 8 columns) – contains the same variables as `community_lake.rda`, along with detailed information about the biomass of the species caught during the sampling event (`data`, `sp_vector`, `rel_bm`).  
- `community_stream` – (48,879 lines x 7 columns) – includes the sampling event ID (`opcod`), the species code (`species`) and the associated biomass (standardised or not: `bm_std`, `biomass`) and length (`length`) as well as the number of individuals with these attributes (standardised or not: `nind_std`, `nind`).  
- `community_stream_metrics` – (6,358 lines x 11 columns) – contains the same variables as `community_stream.rda`, along with detailed information about the biomass of the species caught during the sampling event, the richness of the community, and the surface used to standardise metrics (`richness`, `surface`, `rich_std`, `data`, `sp_vector`, `rel_bm`). 
- `dataset_lake_stream` – (3,188 lines x 21 columns) – includes the ecosystem type (`type`), the code of the sampling station (`station`), the sampling event ID (`opcod`), the sampling year (`year`), the latitude (`lat`) and the longitude (`long`) of the sampling station, information related to hydrographic basins and topographic watersheds (`CdBH`, `LbBH`, `CdOH`, `TopoOH`) as well as the associated BOD value (`dbo`), temperature  (`temp`), connectance (`connectance`), richness (`richness`), number of nodes (`nbnode`), average of trophic level weighted by the biomass (`w_trph_lvl_avg`), maximum trophic level (`max_troph_lvl`), altitude (`altitude`), dissolved oxygen (`oxgen`), total nitrogen (`nitrogen`), total phosphorus (`phosphore`).
